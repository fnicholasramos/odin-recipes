  <p>Coffee jelly is a delightful dessert with soft, jiggly cubes of rich and coffee-flavored.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups of brewed coffee (strong)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of gelatin powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of water (for dissolving gelatin)</li>
    <li>Whipped cream or sweetened condensed milk (for topping, optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Brew Coffee:</strong> Brew 2 cups of strong coffee and mix in 2 tablespoons of sugar while it's hot. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then set aside.</li>

    <li><strong>Dissolve Gelatin:</strong> In a small bowl, dissolve 1 tablespoon of gelatin powder in 1/4 cup of warm water. Stir well and let it sit for a minute or two.</li>

    <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Pour the dissolved gelatin mixture into the hot coffee and stir until fully combined.</li>

    <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Pour the mixture into a shallow dish or container and let it cool to room temperature. Once cooled, refrigerate for 2-4 hours or until fully set.</li>

    <li><strong>Cut into Cubes:</strong> Once the jelly is firm, cut it into small cubes.</li>

    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Spoon the coffee jelly into glasses or bowls. Top with whipped cream or drizzle with sweetened condensed milk for extra indulgence.</li>
